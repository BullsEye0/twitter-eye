# X-eye

## X Information Gathering Tool

X Eye is an X Information Gathering Tool
With X Eye, you can search with various keywords and usernames on Twitter. Then, the data you get is saved in a .csv file. This is to make it easy to read. You can then open these files in Excel, LibreOffice or etc.
X Eye is WITHOUT an API Key that you need with most tools for X. 

"Let's make everything easy.".. 

Since I'm currently working on a project and I've created this script for it, I thought it would be a good idea to make it public for everyone to benefit from.

Hi there, Shall we play a game..? ðŸ˜ƒ

Have some fun..!

## Install X Eye:

To get started with X Eye, you obviously have `python3` and `pip3` installed.

If you haven't installed this yet, enter the following commands:


``sudo apt install python3``


``sudo install python3-pip``

---

# Setting Up Your Environment
Use a virtual environment (optional but recommended): For Python-based tools, itâ€™s good practice to use a virtual environment so you donâ€™t clutter your system Python. Create one with:

```python3 -m venv osint-env```

```source osint-env/bin/activate```

This creates and activates a virtual environment named osint-env. Youâ€™ll see your prompt change (often prefixed with (osint-env)), indicating the venv is active. (If you later want to exit the virtual environment, just run `deactivate`.)

## Install the GitHub Repository X Eye:


``git clone https://github.com/BullsEye0/twitter-eye.git``

``cd twitter-eye``
  
``pip3 install -r requirements.txt``

``python3 twitter-eye.py``
